OK, if I do 3x30s in g & r, that should be plenty for all of them. and that's just 6 min per object. It'll only take me an hour to get them all.  Then, repeat but add the i-band I guess?




Estimates of brightnesses
A: ~22.1 mag in g- and r-band
B: ~22.4 mag in g- and r-band
C: ~21.5 mag in g- and r-band
D: ~22.4 mag in g- and r-band
E: ~21.9 mag in g- and r-band
F: ~22.8 mag in g- and r-band
G: ~23.1 mag in g- and r-band
H: ~23.3 mag in g- and r-band
I: ~23.6 mag in g- and r-band

Order for i-band observations:
B > A > D > E > G > C > F > H > I

Rough calc of the exposure times I need.  Based on SPIcam, so should be more than enough with ARCTIC.
