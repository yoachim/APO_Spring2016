Anyway, please pay more attention on MUSSES_1604D, let's take u, g, r, i, z images of these target. The r-band apparent magnitude of MUSSES_1604D is brighter than ~20.5 mag. The g, i and z band magnitude should be comparable with this value. But u-band should be much fainter, so if it is difficult to take u-band image for target fainter than 21 mag, we can just focus on g, r, i and z band. Hope the S/N in each band can reach to at least 20 (hopefully g- and r-band could be better).

For the rest time, please take g, r, and i band of each object follow the sequence: A > B > F > E (please skip to the next target if you cannot distinguish anything in a 240s r-band image, I think most targets in this group should be visible if the sky is clear).

Then, please take g and r band image for C, G, H, I (please skip to the next target if you cannot distinguish anything in a 240s r-band image).



Log in early so I can get dome flats and bias frames
