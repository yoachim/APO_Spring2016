#Plan for APO observations April 11, 2016#

Start time 01:16, end 03:34

Using the Arctic imager with g,r,i,z filters loaded.

##Planned Calibration Frames## 
1. bias frames
2. Dome flats? (note, since we only have the telescope in the middle of the night, might need to log in extra early, and/or stay late to get flats and bias frames.  Looks like others are doing spectra, so we can probably get twilight time if needed)
3. Twilight flats? Twilight flats are the recommended way to flat filed ARCTIC.
4. Standard stars?--not needed

Can log in early to get flats and bias frames
g,r,i flats. With dim quartz take 15, 5, 2s exposures.


##Target List##
ID, RA, Dec, mag

##Observing Strategy##

want g and r on each day. i-band if there is extra time.
Want S/N of 15. SNR of 10 ok in i-band.


Rough calc of the exposure times I need.  Based on SPIcam, so should be more than enough with ARCTIC.
