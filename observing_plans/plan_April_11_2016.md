#Plan for APO observations April 11, 2016#

Start time 01:16, end 03:34

Using the Arctic imager with g,r,i,z filters loaded.

##Planned Calibration Frames## 
1. bias frames
2. Dome flats? (note, since we only have the telescope in the middle of the night, might need to log in extra early, and/or stay late to get flats and bias frames.  Looks like others are doing spectra, so we can probably get twilight time if needed)
3. Twilight flats?
4. Standard star fields?

##Target List##
ID, RA, Dec, mag

##Observing Strategy##

Filter sequence, exposure times, dither strategy? (e.g., 3x60s z-band observations with ~10 arcsec dither steps, 3x30s g-band...)
