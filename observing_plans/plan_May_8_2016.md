It seems that the MUSSES_1604D is becoming redder, could you take at least 3 x 180s (or 5  x 120s) exposures in g-band tonight?


It seems that some of objects cannot be identified (B, E, F and G) now. So I would like to give up them and spend more time on other objects, especially for MUSSES_1604D. Please add more exposures of MUSSES_1604D in each band (let's take u, g, r, i, z again).

Then, we can take g, r, and i band for A and C.

For the rest time, please take g and r band image for H and I.
