7:34		0029-30						MUSSES_1604A	30		r 	1.4			Little faint, but still in twilight		
7:36		31-33						MUSSES_1604A    120		i 	1.4			That looks good
7:44		34-36 						MUSSES_1604A  	120		r 	1.37     	(come back for g later)
7:51 		37-39 						1604D 			120 	r 	1.31 		huge signal.
7:58 		40-44 						1604D 			60,120 	z	1.29 		wow. A bit fainter in z!

8:52 		61	 						1604E 			240 	r 	1.19 		ghosts! 
9:02 -- getting focus check.  1.6" seeing
9:08 		64							1604E 			120		r 	1.18 		give it one more chance to spot after re-focus
9:12 		65 							1604E 			120 	i 	1.177 		so there is a new object in the frame, but not in the box...
9:15 		66-67 						1604E 			120		g 	1.176 		
Going to shoot 1604E on the off-chance the finder box was off, since I see a new object.

9:49 		76 							1604H 			240 	r 	1.19		kinda see the fuzzy thing.
9:53 		77 							1604I 			240 	r 	1.481 		Maybe in there?

10:30 		88-91 						1604D 			240 	z 	1.227 		I see it! This might be hard to flat field...Take an extra to maybe be able to build a sky flat.
10:48 		92-95 						1604D 			240 	u 	1.256 		If you know where to look, it's kinda there.
